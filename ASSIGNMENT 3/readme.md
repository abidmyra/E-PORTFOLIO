## Summary on the Visit to UTMDigital and the Attended Virtual Talk

The visit to the UTMDigital impressed me as I could see the management and the operation of the technology there. I could also see how great the facilities were in every corner of the building of UTMDigital. Furthermore, this visit provided students with the opportunity to witness firsthand how the technologies and systems we have studied in the subjects of our course are applied in real-life scenarios, especially after we attended the virtual talk about the overall UTMDigital's services.

## Suggstions for improvement
