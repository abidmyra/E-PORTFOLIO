## Summary on what have I gained from the Assemble PC Lab

The assemble PC lab helped me and my classmates gain insights into the different components of a PC and how they work together.
Assembling a PC involves connecting various hardware components like the CPU, RAM, motherboard, storage devices, and hard disk.
This assemble PC lab definitely provides a hands-on experience and allowing me along with other students to physically handle and 
connect these components. This lab could made us easily relate to chapter two in subject Technology and Information System which is Hardware.

## Suggestions for improvements

I think, the students should be introduced to Networking Hardware too in the assemble PC lab such as routers, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).
The laboratory manager or laboratory staffs can xplain the role of each component in a network and how they interact to facilitate data communication.
Other than that, they also can guide students in setting up a basic local area network (LAN) using routers and switches or teach them about IP addressing
and the basics of network configuration.
