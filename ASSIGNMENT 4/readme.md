## Summary on what have I gained from the Industry Talk 2

I learned many new things about analytics, what its meaning, which fields analytics can be applied, what careers are in analytics and what technology 
that people who worked in analytics use. Ms. Qistina explained the process of attaining a fundamental of analytics which she said whichever field we 
take; the basics of the analytics is this process. To explain it shortly, the order of the process is data collection, data transformation, analytics modelling, 
prediction and visualization and insights.

## Suggestions for Improvements

I personally think most speakers should talk more about the software skills or common soft skills that someone should develops as early as they can to train
themselves before facing the challenges in finding a job they want or share about their experience in becoming someone skilled in technology field.

## Others

I imagine that I will be a system developer in the next four years by continuous learning in latest tools and technologies as the technologies may 
be advanced from days to days. I will increase my experience in system development or focus on creating a user-friendly development environment.
