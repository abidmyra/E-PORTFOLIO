## Summary on What have I gained from the visit to NALI 2023

I really believed that this planned activities enabled students to delve deeper into the realm of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for learning and teaching. Whether on a local or overseas platform, the students would discovered numerous opportunities, as long as these platforms have a global reach. The presentations and interviews scheduled for the event demonstrated to students the various ways ICT can significantly enhance their learning experiences in their respective courses.

## Suggestions for improvement

Introduce smaller breakout sessions or workshops that allow attendees to delve deeper into specific topics or engage in hands-on activities. This provides a more enganging setting for discussions and promotes active participation.

## Others

I personally suggests all students, even not from computing faculty, to visits the NALI events to provide them exposure to the technological advances because I think 
all students should also gains basic knowledge about IT and technology. People nowadays basically use advanced technologies and applications in their daily life. So,
this event may help them learn something about Information and Communications Technology in learning and teaching which is related with them indirectly.
