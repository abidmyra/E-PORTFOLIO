# Reflection on NALI 2023's Visit

## Summary on What have I gained from the visit to NALI 2023

I really believed that this planned activities enabled students to delve deeper into the realm of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for learning and teaching. Whether on a local or overseas platform, the students would discovered numerous opportunities, as long as these platforms have a global reach. The presentations and interviews scheduled for the event demonstrated to students the various ways ICT can significantly enhance their learning experiences in their respective courses.

## Suggestions for improvement

Introduce smaller breakout sessions or workshops that allow attendees to delve deeper into specific topics or engage in hands-on activities. This provides a more enganging setting for discussions and promotes active participation.
