# Reflections on Design Thinking

## Summary on what have I gained from the design thinking üìú

I personally think the design thinking project truly did helped me learned on how to be more creative as a person. In addition, we did this as a group so
we no doubt could hone teamwork skills starting from now. The working life in the future surely will not be easy as it requires us as a computer science 
graduate to always think more and increase our critical thinking skills. Nowadays, people wan to find someone who have a unique thinking or with more skills
to make them their workers especially in IT or technology field. To be someone who always know or trying the solution for every problem, this design thinking
may quite helped us a lot as a students.

## Suggestions for improvement ‚úíÔ∏è

In my opinion , I think maybe students can be allowed to attend any workshops, conferences, and engage with design thinking communities to stay updated on industry best practices. This is to ensure students to stay informed about emerging technologies and trends that could impact their design. From that, students also can consider on how new technologies can be integrated to enhance user experiences.

## Personal Reflections and Creativity üí°

I'm really grateful to work in a group with a reliable and responsible team members. They didn't hesitate to help me if I ask them for help in doing my part.
All of them were very clear with their tasks and each of them were determined to finish their tasks together as soon as possible that made me also felt eagered 
to have it done early before the due date. I hope in the future I still get to work with great team members who never run out of ideas when doing a group
project design thinking.
